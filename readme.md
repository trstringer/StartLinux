# Helper function to start Linux VM

Here's a quick ps module I created so that I can, with a single command, start my Linux VM and launch `vmconnect.exe`.

On my machine my VM doesn't start right away and sometimes errors out.  So instead of troubleshoot *why* that happens it's just easier to keep retrying until successful.

## Usage

`linux`
